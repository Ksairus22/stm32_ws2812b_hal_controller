# stm_ws2812b_hal_controller

Controlling WS2812b RGB leds and led strips with an STM32F103 blue pill board and STM32 HAL.

This is actually really hard and there a bunch of overcomplicated or simply non-working examples out there.

Credit for this ws2812b library actually goes to Nico Korn @(https://github.com/nicokorn/STM32F1XX_WS2812B/).
You are awesome!

Simply hook up your led(s) to 3.3v, GND and PA0 and there you go!
